# Profiles

Profiles are one of the most effective ways to expand the versatility of your Mixlar Mix.  
They allow you to save complete mixer configurations — including slider assignments, volumes, mute states, and colors.  
This makes it easy to switch between entirely different workflows without rebuilding your setup each time.

## Why Use Profiles?

You can create an unlimited number of profiles to keep different workflows organized.  
Common examples include:

- Gaming  
- Productivity  
- Streaming  
- Music or MIDI setups  

Each profile stores its own slider configuration, bindings, and mute states, allowing the Mixlar Mix to adapt instantly to whatever you're doing.

## Creating a New Profile

1. Open **Profiles** in the left sidebar  
2. Enter a name (e.g., Gaming, Work, Streaming)  
3. Click **Save Profile**  

Your current configuration is now stored as a reusable profile.

---

## Switching Profiles

You can switch profiles in two different ways:

### 1. Using the Profile Dropdown (Top Bar)

Mixlar Control displays a profile selector in the title bar when enabled.

Select a profile from the dropdown to load it instantly.

### 2. Using Macro Buttons

Macro buttons (if available) can be configured to:

- Switch to a specific profile  
- Move to the next or previous profile  
- Open the profile menu  

This is especially useful during streaming or gaming, where fast switching matters.

---

## Important Behavior: Volume Syncing

The Mixlar Mix is designed to prevent sudden volume jumps when switching profiles.

- When you load a new profile, your PC’s current audio levels remain unchanged  
- Audio does *not* snap to the slider’s saved position  
- The volume only updates once you move the physical slider  

This is ideal for maintaining smooth transitions between tasks without unexpected changes in volume.

---

## Profile Visibility

Each profile includes a **Visible** toggle.

- Enabled → The profile appears in the dropdown  
- Disabled → The profile is hidden but still saved  

This helps you keep your workspace uncluttered while maintaining backup or specialized profiles.

---

## Managing Profiles

Within the Profiles page, you can:

- Load a profile  
- Delete a profile  
- Hide or show profiles in the selector  

Everything updates instantly and safely.
