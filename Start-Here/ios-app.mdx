   - See [Web Controller Setup](/web-controller-setup#firewall-configuration)

### Connection Keeps Dropping

**Solutions**:

   - Restart Tailscale app

3. **Check network stability:**
   - Move closer to WiFi router
   - Switch to cellular if WiFi is unstable (Tailscale only)

### Login Fails

**Issue**: "Invalid username or password" error

**Solutions**:

1. Verify credentials in the desktop app:

**Solutions**:

   - Copy exactly from the Network tab on PC

3. **Verify certificates are generated:**

   - If not, click "Generate HTTPS Certificates"

4. **Test from Safari first:**
   - Open Safari on your iPhone

   - If this works, the issue is with the app

### Sliders or Macros Don't Respond

**Issue**: Tapping buttons or moving sliders has no effect

**Solutions**:

1. **Check connection status:**
