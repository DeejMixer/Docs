description: Complete guide to setting up and configuring the Mixlar Control Web Controller
---

## Overview

The Web Controller plugin allows you to access and control your Mixlar mixer from any device with a web browser - phones, tablets, laptops, or other computers on your network.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- Mixlar Control desktop application installed and running
- ESP32-S3 hardware controller connected via USB
- Device connected to your local network (WiFi or Ethernet)

## Enable Web Controller

### Step 1: Open Plugin Settings

1. Launch **Mixlar Control** on your PC
2. Click the **Settings** gear icon (top-right corner)
3. Select **Plugins** from the left-side menu
4. Locate the **Web Controller** plugin tile

### Step 2: Enable the Plugin

1. Click on the **Web Controller** tile
2. Toggle the **Enable** switch to ON
3. The plugin will activate and show four configuration tabs

## Configuration Tabs

The Web Controller plugin has four main configuration sections:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configure">
    Port and basic settings
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    Authentication and access control
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Remote Access">
    Tailscale and HTTPS setup
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Network">
    Network information and connection details
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configure Tab

This tab controls the basic web server settings.

**Port Configuration:**

1. Click the **Configure** tab
2. Enter your preferred port number
   - Default: `5000`
   - Common alternatives: `5001`, `8080`, `3000`
3. Click **Save** to apply changes

**When to change the port:**
- Port 5000 is already in use by another application
- You want to run multiple instances
- Your organization requires specific ports

<Warning>
  After changing the port, you'll need to restart the Web Controller server for changes to take effect.
</Warning>

### Security Tab

Set up authentication to protect your mixer from unauthorized access.

**Create Login Credentials:**

1. Click the **Security** tab
2. Enter a **username** (e.g., `admin`, `mixer`, your name)
3. Enter a strong **password**
4. Click **Save**

<Info>
  **Password Requirements:**
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Include numbers and symbols
  - Avoid common words or personal information
</Info>

**Example strong passwords:**
```
MixlarControl2024!
Slider#Mixer$789
Audio@Remote#2024
```

<Warning>
  Anyone with access to your username and password can control your mixer. Never share your credentials or use weak passwords.
</Warning>

### Remote Access Tab

Enable secure remote access from anywhere using Tailscale.

**Generate HTTPS Certificates:**

1. Click the **Remote Access** tab
2. Click the **Generate HTTPS Certificates** button
3. Wait for the generation process to complete (10-30 seconds)
4. You'll see a success message when ready

**Enable Tailscale:**

1. Ensure you have Tailscale installed and running on your PC
2. Toggle the **Enable Tailscale** switch to ON
3. The server will restart with HTTPS enabled
4. Your secure Tailscale URL will appear in the Network tab

<Note>
  HTTPS certificates are required for Tailscale remote access. They encrypt all data between your device and the PC.
</Note>

**Why Generate Certificates?**
- Encrypts all web traffic (HTTPS)
- Required for Tailscale integration
- Protects your login credentials
- Prevents eavesdropping on your local network

### Network Tab

View connection information and access URLs.

**Information Displayed:**

- **Local IP Address**: Your PC's IP on the local network
- **Port**: The port Web Controller is running on
- **Local URL**: Access link for devices on the same network
- **Tailscale URL**: Secure remote access link (if enabled)
- **Available Networks**: WiFi networks your PC can connect to

**Local Access URLs:**

```
http://192.168.1.100:5000  (Example - your IP will differ)
http://localhost:5000       (On the same PC)
```

**Tailscale Access URL:**

```
https://mixlar-yourpc.tailnet-name.ts.net:5000  (Example)
```

<Tip>
  Save the Tailscale URL to your phone's home screen for quick access!

## Firewall Configuration

Windows Firewall may block incoming connections. Here's how to allow access:

### Automatic (First Run)

When you first start the server, Windows may show a firewall prompt:
1. Check both "Private networks" and "Public networks"
2. Click **Allow access**

### Manual Configuration

If you didn't see the prompt or need to add the rule manually:

1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall**
2. Click **Allow an app through firewall**
3. Click **Change settings** (requires admin)
4. Click **Allow another app**
5. Browse to Python or Mixlar Control executable
6. Click **Add**
7. Check both **Private** and **Public** boxes
8. Click **OK**

Or use Command Prompt (as Administrator):

```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Mixlar Web Controller" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Access Web Interface

**Issue**: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify server is running (check for green status in plugin settings)
2. Confirm you're using the correct IP address and port
3. Check firewall settings (see above)
4. Try accessing `http://localhost:5000` from the PC first
5. Ensure both devices are on the same network

### Login Page Shows Old Design

**Issue**: Login page appears outdated or blank

**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh the browser: Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try opening in incognito/private mode

### Login Fails

**Issue**: "Invalid username or password" error

**Solutions**:
1. Verify username and password in Security tab
2. Passwords are case-sensitive
3. Reset credentials in plugin settings if needed
4. Ensure you clicked "Save" after setting credentials

### Port Already in Use

**Issue**: "Port 5000 is already in use" error

**Solutions**:
1. Change port in Configure tab to `5001` or `8080`
2. Find what's using the port:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   ```
3. Close the application using that port
4. Restart Web Controller server

### Cannot Access from Mobile

**Issue**: Mobile browser can't connect

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure both PC and mobile are on the same WiFi network
2. Verify PC's firewall allows connections (see Firewall Configuration)
3. Check if your WiFi router has client isolation enabled (disable it)
4. Try connecting from another device to isolate the issue
5. Disable VPN on mobile device temporarily

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Strong Passwords">
    Always use strong, unique passwords. Avoid:
    - Default passwords (admin/password)
    - Personal information (birthdays, names)
    - Common words or phrases
    - Reusing passwords from other services
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Tailscale for Remote Access">
    If you need access outside your local network, always use Tailscale instead of port forwarding. Tailscale provides:
    - End-to-end encryption
    - No exposed ports to the internet
    - Secure VPN tunnel
    - HTTPS encryption
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Credentials Regularly">
    Change your username and password periodically, especially if:
    - You suspect credentials were compromised
    - Someone who knew them no longer needs access
    - It's been more than 6 months
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Access Logs">
    Check who's accessing your mixer:
    - Review login attempts in the console
    - Watch for unexpected connections
    - Log out when not in use
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
