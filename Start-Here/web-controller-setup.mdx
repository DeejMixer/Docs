3. Toggle **Enable** to ON

## Configuration Tabs

### Configure

Set the web server port.

- **Default**: 5000
- **Alternatives**: 5001, 8080, 3000

Change only if port 5000 is already in use.

### Security

1. Enter **username**
2. Enter **password** (use a strong password)

### Remote Access

Enable secure remote access with Tailscale.

1. Click **Generate HTTPS Certificates** (required for Tailscale)
2. Wait for completion
3. Toggle **Enable Tailscale** to ON

<Note>
You must install Tailscale on your PC first. See [Tailscale Setup](/remote-access-tailscale).
</Note>

### Network

View connection information.

- **Local URL**: Use on same WiFi
- **Tailscale URL**: Use from anywhere

Copy the URL you need and use it to connect.

## Accessing the Web Interface

**Same PC:**
```
http://localhost:5000
```

**Same WiFi Network:**
```
http://YOUR_PC_IP:5000
```
Find your IP: Command Prompt → `ipconfig` → IPv4 Address

**Anywhere (Tailscale):**
```
https://your-tailscale-url:5000
```
Copy from Network tab

## Firewall Setup

If you can't connect from other devices:

**Windows:**
1. Windows Defender Firewall
2. Allow an app through firewall
3. Find Python or Mixlar Control
4. Check both Private and Public
5. Click OK

Or run as Administrator:
```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Mixlar Web" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000
```

## Common Issues

**Can't access from phone:**
- Both devices on same WiFi?
- Firewall configured?
- Web Controller running?

**Login fails:**
- Check username/password in Security tab
- Passwords are case-sensitive

**Port already in use:**
- Change port in Configure tab
- Try 5001 or 8080
