## Troubleshooting

**Can't connect:**
- Tailscale running on both devices?
- Both signed in to same account?
- Certificates generated?
- Mixlar Control running?

**Certificate warning:**
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed"
- This is expected for self-signed certificates

**Slow connection:**

- Try WiFi instead of cellular
