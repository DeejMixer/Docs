## Wireless (BLE) connection

Once USB is working, you can switch to wireless mode using Bluetooth Low Energy.

<Info>
  Your computer must support **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** or use the **Mixlar BLE dongle** for wireless mode to work.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Connections page">

  In the settings sidebar, go to **Connections** and select the **Wireless** tab at the top.

  />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pair via USB">

  With your Mixlar Mix still plugged in via USB, click **Pair via USB**.  
  This links the device to Mixlar Control for wireless use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Power the mixer without USB">

  Unplug the USB data cable, then power the Mixlar Mix using:

  - Its battery, or  
  - An external USB power source (not connected to the PC)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect from the mixer">

  When the Mixlar Mix shows the wireless **Connect** screen, press the **Connect** button on the device.  
  The device will appear in the Wireless list (for example: `Mixlar Control E864`), and the connection will switch to BLE.

  On the mixer home screen:

  - A **wireless icon** indicates BLE mode  
  - A **USB icon** indicates wired mode
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The mixer does not appear on any COM port">
    - Make sure the Mixlar Mix is powered on and connected directly (avoid unpowered hubs).  
    - Try a different USB port or cable.  
    - Close other audio/control apps that might be locking the device.  
    - Restart Mixlar Control and re-open the **Device** tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Status stays Disconnected after selecting a COM port">
    - Try another COM port from the dropdown (it is rarely `COM1`).  
    - Unplug and reconnect the Mixlar Mix, then click **Refresh** next to the COM dropdown and try again.  
    - Check your system's Device Manager (Windows) or System Information (macOS) to confirm the device is detected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wireless option not working">
    - Confirm your PC supports Bluetooth Low Energy or that the Mixlar BLE dongle is plugged in.  
    - Make sure you have paired **via USB** first in the Wireless tab.  
    - Keep the Mixlar Mix within Bluetooth range and avoid heavy interference.  
    - If it still fails, unplug the device, restart Mixlar Control, and repeat the pairing steps.
