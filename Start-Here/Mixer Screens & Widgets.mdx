# Mixer Screens & Widgets

Your Mixlar Mix has four primary screens:

- Main Control
- Spotify
- Stats
- ScreenSaver

You can switch pages by **pressing and holding the Master Volume dial for one second**.  
A page menu will appear—rotate the dial to highlight a screen, then press to select it.

## Main Control Screen

The Main Control screen is the default view when your mixer is connected.

  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

It shows:

- All active **sliders**
- The **macro button grid**
- Connection state (for example, Connected to PC)
- Master volume percentage

This screen reflects whatever you’ve configured in the **Sliders** and **Macros** sections of Mixlar Control. There is no extra setup required here.

## Spotify Screen

The Spotify screen provides a full-screen player view with large text and transport controls.  
It also powers Spotify macros and toast overlays.

### Enable Spotify

1. Open **Settings → Connections → Spotify** in Mixlar Control.  
2. Click **Sign in with Spotify**.  
3. Complete the login in your browser.  

Once connected, the Spotify page becomes available on the mixer and can be selected from the page menu.

### What the Spotify screen shows

- Current song title and artist  
- Next track in the queue  
- A background color that syncs with the album art  

### Use mute buttons as Spotify controls

You can repurpose the four mute buttons as transport controls when the Spotify page is active.

In Mixlar Control:

1. Go to **Settings → General → Behaviors**.  
2. Enable **Use Mute Buttons for Spotify Controls**.

When this option is enabled and you’re on the Spotify page:

- Mute 1: Previous track  
- Mute 2: Play / Pause  
- Mute 3: Next track  
- Mute 4: Like / Heart the current song

## Spotify Toast Overlay

The Spotify connection also enables a compact overlay that can appear on **any screen**, not just the Spotify page.

The overlay can show:

- Current song and artist  
- When music is paused or resumed  
- When a track is liked or unliked  

Configure it under:

**Settings → Notifications → Spotify**

There you can:

- Turn Spotify notifications on or off  
- Adjust how long they stay on screen  
- Prevent them from appearing while you are already on the Spotify page

## Stats Screen

The Stats screen focuses on system monitoring. It shows live widgets for CPU, GPU, RAM, and network activity.

<Image
  src="/images/mixer-stats-screen.png"
  alt="PC stats widgets screen"
  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

Typical tiles include:

- CPU usage, clock speed, and temperature  
- GPU usage, power draw, and temperature  
- RAM usage  
- Fan speeds  
- Network upload/download and latency  

The Stats screen requires no additional configuration in most setups. As long as Mixlar Control is running on your PC, data will populate automatically.

---

## ScreenSaver Screen

The ScreenSaver page is a flexible, always-on view that can show the time, weather, and current song, with a customizable background.

<Image

  alt="Clock, date, weather, and now playing on the screensaver"
  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

Open **Settings → ScreenSaver** in Mixlar Control to configure it.

### Behavior tab

<Image
  src="/images/screensaver-behavior.png"
  alt="ScreenSaver behavior settings in Mixlar Control"
  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

Key options:

- **Enable ScreenSaver** – master on/off  
- **Enable on sub-screens (Spotify, Stats)** – choose whether the ScreenSaver can activate while those pages are visible  
- **Timeout** – how long the mixer waits (for example 5, 10, or 30 minutes) before switching to ScreenSaver  
- **Use 24-hour time format** – optional time display style  

### Weather tab

<Image
  src="/images/screensaver-weather.png"
  alt="Weather configuration for the screensaver"
  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

Here you can:

- Enable or disable weather  
- Choose a provider  
- Set a location (or use auto-detect)  
- Toggle Celsius vs Fahrenheit  

Weather information refreshes periodically and appears in the top corner of the ScreenSaver.

### Theme tab

<Image
  src="/images/screensaver-theme.png"
  alt="Background color theme options"
  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

Use this tab to:

- Select a preset background color  
- Use a custom color (enter a hex value)  

This color applies to the ScreenSaver and helps it match your room or desktop theme.

### Spotify tab

<Image
  src="/images/screensaver-spotify.png"
  alt="Enable Spotify integration on the screensaver"
  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "16px" }}
/>

When **Enable Spotify** is turned on, the ScreenSaver can show:

- Current song  
- Artist  
- A minimal now-playing indicator at the bottom of the screen

## Navigating Between Screens

To change pages on the mixer at any time:

1. **Press and hold** the Master Volume dial for about **one second**.  
2. A page selector will appear.  
3. Rotate the dial to highlight **Main**, **Spotify**, **Stats**, or **ScreenSaver**.  
4. Press the dial again to confirm.

This works whether you are connected over USB or BLE.
