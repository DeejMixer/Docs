# Sliders

Sliders are one of the core features of the Mixlar Mix.  
Each slider can control **audio**, **MIDI**, **system actions**, or **smart home devices**.  
You can also assign custom colors to keep your layout organized and easy to recognize.

## Custom slider colors

Every slider can be assigned a custom color.

- Default color follows your theme  
- Click the color square next to any slider to change it  
- Colors help quickly identify slider purpose  

Many users use:

- Purple for music  
- Green for chat  
- Red for microphone  
- Blue for game audio  
- Orange for system functions  

Color coding is especially helpful when using multiple profiles.

## Multi-binding (controlling more than one thing)

Sliders can control more than one source at once.  
This allows you to build grouped audio controls or hybrid system sliders.

Examples:

- Group all browser tabs + music players  
- Control Discord + Zoom volume simultaneously  
- Pair mic volume with noise suppression level  
- Link multiple smart devices to one slider  

Just select more than one item inside the Assignment Window.

After choosing your assignments:

1. Click **Save**  
2. Move the physical slider on your Mixlar Mix  
3. The selected sources will adjust instantly  

Your slider is now fully configured and ready for daily use.
