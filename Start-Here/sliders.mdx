# Sliders

The sliders on your Mixlar Mix allow you to control audio levels, system actions, MIDI outputs, smart home features, and more.  
Each slider can be assigned multiple inputs or actions to create a custom workflow that fits your setup.

---

## Adding a Slider Source

On the main Mixlar Control screen, each slider has a **+** button underneath it.

Clicking this **+** icon opens the assignment window where you can choose what the slider will control.

## The Assignment Window

After clicking **+**, a new window appears where you can pick what the slider controls.  
You can select **one or multiple sources** for each slider.

### Available Tabs:

### **🎧 Audio**
Control application audio or system audio, such as:

- Game audio  
- Music apps (Spotify, YouTube Music, browsers, etc.)  
- Chat apps (Discord, Zoom, Teams)  
- Specific Windows processes (e.g., `audiodg.exe`)  
- System output volume  

### **🎹 MIDI**
Use the slider to send MIDI CC values to DAWs or music software.

### **🏠 Smart Home**
*(Requires Smart Home setup)*

Control:

- Lights  
- Scenes  
- Smart devices  
- Volume of smart speakers, etc.

### **⚙️ System**
This tab gives access to powerful system-level controls, such as:

- Microphone volume  
- Speaker output volume  
- Screen brightness  
- Switching active windows  
- Media controls  
- System actions  

These features make Mixlar Mix especially useful for:

- SonarGG setups  
- Productivity workflows  
- Stream control  
- Improving accessibility

---

## Multi-Binding

Each slider can control **multiple sources at once**.

For example:

- Control Discord + YouTube volume together  
- Control your mic volume + mic noise suppression  
- Control all browser-based audio as one group  

Just select more than one item in the assignment window before saving.

---

## Custom Slider Colors

To help you recognize sliders quickly, each slider can have a **custom color**.

- By default, the color matches your theme  
- Click the color box on the main screen to choose any color you want  
- Many users color-code by category (e.g., purple = music, green = chat, red = mic)

This is especially helpful on wireless setups or in low-light environments.

---

## Saving & Using the Slider

Once you’ve selected your inputs:

1. Click **Save**
2. The slider becomes active immediately
3. You can test it by moving the physical slider on the Mixlar Mix

Your Mixlar Mix will now control whatever you assigned—audio, MIDI, smart home devices, or system controls.
