# Sliders

Sliders are the heart of your Mixlar Mix.  
Each slider can control **audio**, **MIDI**, **system actions**, and even **smart home devices**—and each one can be color-coded to match your workflow.

## 🎚️ Adding a Slider Source

To assign a slider, click the **+ button** beneath the slider on the main Mixlar Control page.

This opens the **Assignment Window**, where you choose what the slider controls.  
You can even bind **multiple sources** to the same slider for grouped control.

---

## 🪟 The Assignment Window

When the Assignment Window opens, you'll see several tabs across the top.  
Each tab represents a different category of controls that your slider can manage.

## 🎨 Custom Slider Colors

Each slider can be color-coded for visual clarity.

- Defaults to theme color  
- Click the **color box** next to any slider  
- Choose any custom color to match your workflow  

Many users use colors like:

- 🟣 Music  
- 🟢 Chat  
- 🔴 Microphone  
- 🔵 Games  
- 🟠 System  

Color-coding makes it easy to identify sliders at a glance—especially in wireless mode.

## 🧩 Multi-Binding (Control Multiple Things at Once)

Mixlar allows you to bind **multiple items** to the same slider.

This is useful for:

- Grouping browser + music + video audio  
- Controlling all chat programs together  
- Pairing mic volume with noise suppression levels  
- Linking multiple smart devices to one slider  

Just select more than one item in the Assignment Window and press **Save**.

## 🛠️ Saving & Using Your Slider

After choosing your bindings:

1. Click **Save**  
2. Move the physical slider on your Mixlar Mix  
3. The assigned sources will respond immediately  

Your slider is now fully configured and ready to use.
