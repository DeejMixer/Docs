# Mixlar Mix Hardware Overview

The Mixlar Mix is built around a high-performance **ESP32-S3**, paired with a vibrant full-color display, precision faders, mechanical switches, wireless connectivity, and a layout that feels natural on the desk.

Below is a breakdown of each major component.

---

## 3.5" Full-Color IPS Display

- 3.5-inch IPS panel  
- 320 × 480 RGB pixels  
- Full-color graphics with wide viewing angles  
- Adjustable brightness via Mixlar Control  

The display is used for:

- Real-time stats (CPU, GPU, RAM, network)  
- Album art and Spotify playback  
- Mixer screens and widgets  
- Menus, profiles, and settings feedback  

---

## 75mm Linear Faders (4x)

- Four 75mm linear faders  
- Smooth, precise travel  
- Designed for audio, brightness, and other continuous controls  

Each fader can be assigned to:

- Application audio (games, chat apps, browsers, music players)  
- System volume  
- MIDI control (for compatible workflows)  
- Smart home adjustment (when configured)  
- Multi-binding (controlling more than one thing per fader)

---

## 9 Mechanical Macro Keys

- 9 mechanical keys arranged in a 3×3 grid  
- Tactile mechanical switches for reliable, satisfying presses  
- Mapped through Mixlar Control to whatever actions you need  

Use them for:

- Hotkeys and shortcuts  
- Streaming controls (OBS actions, scene changes, recording)  
- App launches and website opens  
- Multi-step sequences and automation  
- Profile switching or page navigation  

---

## 4 Tactile Mute Buttons

Each fader includes a dedicated mute button.

Common uses:

- Muting or unmuting individual audio sources  
- Acting as Spotify transport controls (previous, play/pause, next, like) when that option is enabled in settings  
- Triggering macros in certain modes  

They provide clear tactile feedback so you can confidently mute or trigger actions without looking down for long.

---

## Master Volume Encoder (Digital Dial)

- 360° digital encoder (infinite rotation)  
- Integrated push-button  

Default behavior:

- Rotate: Adjust **Master Volume**  
- Press and hold (about 1 second): Open the **page selection menu**  
- Press: Confirm selection in menus  

From the page selection menu you can switch between:

- Main screen  
- Stats screen  
- Spotify screen  
- ScreenSaver  

---

## Macro Page Navigation Buttons (2x)

Two dedicated buttons on the device allow you to move between macro pages.

- Quickly flip through four macro pages  
- Up to 36 total macros (9 keys × 4 pages)  
- Page state is remembered when you reconnect the device  

These make it easy to separate workflows (for example: gaming, streaming, productivity, and media).

---

## Dual USB-C Ports

The Mixlar Mix includes two USB-C ports:

### USB-C Port A — Data + Power
- Connects to Mixlar Control on your PC  
- Handles all USB communication for sliders, macros, screens, firmware updates, and BLE pairing  
- Powers the device during wired operation  

### USB-C Port B — Power / BLE Use
- Used primarily as a power input when running in **BLE wireless mode**  
- Can be connected to a USB power adapter, battery pack, or second USB port on your PC  

You can power the device from either port, and in many cases you can have both connected if it suits your setup.

---

## Wireless Connectivity (BLE 5.0)

The Mixlar Mix supports **Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0**, allowing it to run wirelessly when paired through Mixlar Control.

Wireless mode enables:

- Slider and macro control over BLE  
- Wireless stats and display updates  
- Flexible mounting and cable management  

BLE operation typically uses Port B (power only), while data flows over Bluetooth.  
Wired USB mode is recommended for the lowest latency, but BLE is ideal for clean, cable-light setups.

---

## Powered by ESP32-S3

At the core is the **ESP32-S3 microcontroller**, providing:

- Dual-core performance for responsive UI  
- Integrated BLE and USB support  
- Low-power operation for wireless use  
- Fast handling of macros, sliders, and animations  

Firmware is updatable via Mixlar Control so you can benefit from improvements over time.
