# Macros

Macro buttons let you trigger actions with a single press — from basic hotkeys to smart home scenes, OBS controls, and Spotify playback.  
Your Mixlar Mix includes **four macro pages**, giving you plenty of space to separate workflows (for example: Gaming, Streaming, Work, Smart Home).

---

## Macro pages on the mixer

- The mixer has **4 macro pages**.  
- Use the two dedicated **page buttons** on the device to move between pages.  
- Each page has its own set of macros, so you can keep gaming, workflow, streaming, and smart home controls separate.

---

## Editing a macro

To change a macro:

1. Click on any macro button in Mixlar Control.  
2. A **Macro Editor** window will open.  
3. Use the tabs at the top to choose what this button should control:
   - **Macro**
   - **Smart Home**
   - **OBS**
   - **Spotify**

You can also give each macro a **name** and an optional **custom color** to keep your layout easy to read.

## Macro tab (general actions)

The **Macro** tab contains the core actions that run directly on your PC.

Available options:

- **None** – the button does nothing.  
- **Type Text** – insert a text string when pressed.  
- **Hotkey** – send a keyboard shortcut (for example: Ctrl+Shift+M).  
- **Sequence** – chain multiple steps together into a multi-step macro.  
- **Open Website** – launch a URL in your default browser.  
- **Open App** – start an application.  
- **Run Command** – run a system command or script.  
- **Media Control** – play/pause, next, previous, volume, and other media keys.  
- **Load Profile** – switch to a different Mixlar profile instantly.

Use **Sequence** together with **presets** (see below) to build powerful multi-step workflows.

## Smart Home tab

The **Smart Home** tab connects your macros to **Home Assistant**.

You can:

- Toggle lights and switches on or off  
- Adjust brightness levels  
- Change light colors  
- Trigger Home Assistant automations and scenes

  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "18px" }}
/>

This is ideal for streaming setups, studio lighting, or quickly changing your room environment.

---

## OBS tab

If OBS integration is enabled, the **OBS** tab exposes dedicated controls for your streaming setup.

You can create macros for:

- **Scene** switching  
- **Source** visibility  
- **Record** start/stop  
- **Stream** start/stop  
- **Replay** controls  
- **Mute** actions  
- **Other** – use OBS hotkeys you have configured in OBS settings for advanced behaviors

  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "18px" }}
/>

This makes it easy to run a full broadcast from the Mixlar Mix without touching your keyboard.

---

## Spotify tab

The **Spotify** tab uses the Spotify API to control playback.

Available actions include:

- Play / Pause  
- Next Track  
- Previous Track  
- Like / Heart current track  
- Shuffle  
- Repeat / Loop

/>

## Presets and multi-step macros

At the bottom of the Macro Editor, you’ll see **Load Preset…**:

  style={{ borderRadius: "12px", marginTop: "18px" }}
/>

Presets let you:

- Save a macro configuration  
- Reuse it on other buttons  
- Combine it with **Sequence** actions to build multi-step macros quickly  

This is the best way to create complex workflows without rebuilding them from scratch each time.
