# Plugins Overview

Plugins let you extend what Mixlar Mix can do beyond the core features.  
They are currently **experimental** and are focused on improving the user experience and making your setup feel tailored to how you work, create, or play.

<Info>

  Their features and behavior may change between updates as we continue refining the system.

# Mixer Overlay Plugin

The **Mixer Overlay** plugin places a **small, customizable overlay directly on your PC screen**, giving you at-a-glance feedback without ever looking down at your Mixlar Mix.

### What the Overlay Can Show

- Real-time slider movement  
- Volume levels  
- Mute/unmute indicators  
- Macro trigger flashes  
- Spotify now-playing (if enabled)  
- System or profile changes (depending on settings)  

This is extremely helpful when:

- Gaming in fullscreen  
- Streaming  
- Using multiple monitors  
- Editing or working without direct sightline to the mixer  

### Customization Options

Inside **Settings → Plugins → Mixer Overlay**, you can adjust:

- **Position** — place it in any corner or custom location  
- **Size** — scale the overlay larger or smaller  
- **Transparency** — make it subtle or bold  
- **Fade timing** — auto-hide or always show  
- **Enabled elements** — choose which sliders or statuses appear  

The overlay runs completely locally and does **not** record or broadcast your screen — it is purely visual feedback.

# Adobe Creative Cloud Plugin

The **Adobe Creative Cloud** plugin integrates Mixlar Mix with compatible Adobe applications.

### What It Can Do

- Tie sliders to timeline zoom, scrub, or supported parameters  
- Assign macros for editing shortcuts like cut, ripple delete, mark, export  
- Trigger workflow actions from your mixer  
- Improve editing speed and muscle memory  

You can enable the plugin under:

**Settings → Plugins → Adobe Creative Cloud**

Note: Adobe API access varies by version, so features may expand over time.
