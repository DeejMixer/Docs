# Toast Notifications

The Mixlar Toast Notification System lets your Mixlar Mix display real-time updates from your apps — even while you’re gaming, streaming, or in fullscreen mode.  
You can receive alerts from OBS, Spotify, Windows, calendars, email apps, or even custom automation scripts via API.

Windows integration gives you full control of desktop notifications.

### App Filtering

Choose between:

- Showing notifications from all apps (not recommended)  
- Restricting notifications to specific whitelisted apps like Discord, Slack, Outlook, Steam, etc.  

### Custom Message Formatting

Use formatting variables such as:

```
{app}   → App name  
{title} → Notification title  
{body}  → Notification content  
```

Examples:

```
{app}: {title}
{title}
Message from {app}
```

### Display Settings

You can configure:

- Toast visibility duration  
- Max title length  
- Max subtitle/content length  

This ensures notifications remain readable even during gameplay or streaming.
