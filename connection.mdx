## 🧠 Connection Status Tips

You can always tell how your Mixlar Mix is connected:

- **Wireless icon** → BLE connection  
- **USB icon** → Wired USB mode  

If you see the wireless icon on the mixer home screen, you are in BLE mode.

## ⚠️ Requirements for BLE

To use wireless mode, your system needs:

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support**, or  
- The **Mixlar BLE USB Dongle**  

If your PC does not support BLE, wireless mode will not function.
